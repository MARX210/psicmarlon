## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft sky blue (#87CEEB) to evoke calmness and trust.
- Background color: Light off-white (#F9F9F9) to ensure readability and a clean aesthetic.
- Accent color: Gentle teal (#70A1AF) to highlight key interactive elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) provides a modern yet warm feel, making it suitable for both headings and body text.
- Use clear, minimalist icons from a consistent set (e.g., FontAwesome or Material Design) for wayfinding and visual interest.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout with ample whitespace to ensure readability and reduce cognitive load, creating a welcoming, non-intimidating environment.
- Incorporate subtle, non-distracting transitions and animations (e.g., fade-ins, smooth scrolling) to enhance the user experience and provide gentle feedback during interactions.
